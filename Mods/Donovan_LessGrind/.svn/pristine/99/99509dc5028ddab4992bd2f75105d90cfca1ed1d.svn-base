# Donovan LessGrind

## 7 Days 2 Die Modlet

This modlet increases the amount of resources obtained from many sources and also lowers the requirements for building some limited items. The intention is to lower the grind level of the game a bit, for those who don't enjoy that aspect as much.

Changes to recipes are minimal, but do includes things like:

- Foods that should, realistically, only need 1 or 2 meat to create now have lower meat requirements. I mean, c'mon, 5 raw meat to make 1 charred steak is a bit silly.
- Iron bars now take 50% of the iron needed in vanilla (100 iron is a bit much for a single iron bar block)
